TODO for Flightgear JA-37
=========================


Features and improvements:
--------------------------
GUI: Option to turn off verbose popups.
GUI: Improve Checklists.
GUI: Option to switch off hitting stuff above ground. (switched off now, might confuse users)
GUI: Remove from options: Radar, Radar screen and maybe reverse on touchdown. As all these now has switches in cockpit.
Aero: Make cannon pod detachable and have pointweight. (and model it above drop-tank)
Aero: Air-brakes, even though they got welded shut in mid 80ties. (Request from JazzTp)
Control: Pitch damper should also take lateral normal (Nz) acceleration as input as per manual.
Control: Disable failure system from freezing surfaces (remove failure mode bug in 3.2- prevents)
Model: Make minimal polygon model for multiplayer LOD.
Model: Make liveries that is not 59, able to not have to use base texture.
Model: Ext. power truck more mil style textures.
Model: Put in more working instruments and controls.
Model: Make gunpod, between the fuselage and droptank.
Model: The canopy metal should be thinner and unpainted alu.
Model: There should be mirrors on the canopy.
Model: Put in not-working instruments and controls for immersion.
Model: Some textures should be aligned so they can be better viewed from current pilot point of view.
Model: The minimum AoA the indicator should show is -4 degrees, not -7.
Model: The altimeter should have a standard button which set the pressure to 1013 hPa.
Model: Fix that landing gear oleo struts now are too bright.
Animation: Show wheels spinning in MP also.
Animation: Proper animation of gear doors.
Sim: Improve autopilot further. (alt-hold should use pitch not v-speed)
Sim: Make autopilot depend fully on instrument properties not true properties.
Sim: Implement ejection seat. (with parachute?)
Sim: Make braking parachute.
Sim: Reset controls after A/P let go of them.
Sim: Stop using integers in xml where floating point is expected? (really not needed)
Sim: Make verbose property to be used in all nasal scripts. (possible include in options)
Sim: Air to ground guided missiles.
Sim: Longer range air2air missiles.
Sim: Make replay show the guided missiles flying.
Sim: Improve terrain warning system.
Sim: Replace generic setValue in nasal with specific types.
Sim: Make droptank do collision detection. (use retractable)
Sim: Make drop-tank fall down. (use slaved submodel)
Sim: Missiles should lock onto flares.
Sim: Lock warning when another plane get radar lock. (ja37, m2000-5, f-14b)
Sim: Damage from missile explosion.
Sim: Complete hydraulic dependencies. Brakes.
Sim: Hydraulic drain.
Sim: Shift-m should be a key without shift instead for convienience.
Effect: Rembrandt landing lightcone.
Effect: Make pilot faint/die due to G-forces.
Effect: Make tires burst if too high speed with parking brakes.
Effect: Smoke after structural break.
Effect: Adjust normalmap to be more subtle.
Sound: More annunciater warnings and other sounds. (transonic)
Sound: Make sounds when taking damage in bombable.
HUD: Make individual parts in HUD fail if the corresponding instrument fails. (like heading indicator etc.)
HUD: Make boxes for desired pitch.
HUD: Alt scale follow pitch lines at more than 1 degree roll from level flight. (swedish pilots seems able to read upside down, not sure I will make this)
HUD: Make too low reference speed change reticle vertical tail down.
HUD: All track semi circles and semi box should have a line in them. (might degrade performance)
HUD: Sidewind indicator should really be 10 degs below plane axis line.
HUD: Fix that HUD selects diamond_node, not radar logic, so HUD can be turned off in external view.


Bugs:
--------------
Sound: If at the end of non-looped replay view mode is fly-by-view, sounds will continue looping. [not reproduced]
Report: {JabberWocky} After A/P the plane consumes too much fuel. [not reproduceable]
Sim: {JazzTp} On Linux, after firing first missile, the key bindings for weapons go to other things, like exit FG. [Cannot reproduce on Win]
Sim: Missiles do not show when using FG 3.0, in FG 3.1+ they work fine. [reproduced]
Sim: Missiles will not lock on to ferries that is missing the radar properties.
Sim: Find out why cannon and sidewinder fire randomly after instant replay.
Sim: {JazzTp} A repair did repair aircraft except for HUD, it was frozen. [not reproduced yet]
Sim: {JazzTp} Radar screen did not see MP aircraft pass by. [not reproduced yet]
Sim: When relocating or pausing, autostart might fail. [reproduced]
Sim: Missile that misses dont seem to delete by altitude.
Sim: When Bombable 4.5 is installed redout and blackout might not work properly. [related to certain Bombable settings I think]
Sim: The auto-pilot can be bank unstable when auto-coordination is turned on.
HUD: {JazzTp} When FG HUD is in 2nd or 3rd mode, it does not go away when switching to custom. [reproduced]
HUD: I have experienced that tactical mode was on by default. [not reliable reproduced]
HUD: When the altitude difference to a track is much larger than the horizontal distance, the track positions are off.
GUI: The performance monitor can duplicate itself when selecting airport. [reproduced]
Model: sim load-lag when coming near other ja37. [reproduced, select anims are probably to blame]
Model: Sim lag at final retraction of gear. [reproduced, select anims are to blame]
Model: CTRL-X in HUD view will not zoom to correct level.
Animation: Selection view does not follow carriers or other ships till they move. (they lack radar properties)
Model: In FG 2.12 radar screen does not work as it should. (no canvas replacement)
Sim: Sometimes when exploding, the sim freezes, typically at redout.
Sim: {JazzTP} Replay did not replay explosion.
Sound: Could hear aim-9 buzz even though not in tact mode, in external view.
HUD: In landing mode when horizont is out of view, heading scale does not show commanded heading.
HUD: In landing mode, commanded altitude lines can be confused with ILS guidance.
Sim: If track type is selected in HUD, when missile hit the message will display the type, not callsign.


Issues with FG: (or my limited understanding of it)
---------------
Effect: Rembrandt does not make the engine flame lit enough, unless diffuse and ambient is increased also.


Compatible version with FG 2.6 (on hold, as it crashes when loading ja37)
------------------------------
Smaller textures
Less polygons
Less particle effects
No radar (done)
No custom HUD (done)
Default FG HUD (done)
